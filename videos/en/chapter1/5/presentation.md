# How ðŸ¤— Transformers solve tasks

- Overview of NLP, speech, audio, and computer vision tasks.
- Explanation of how models solve these tasks.
- Focus on Transformer models and their variants.

???
In this section, we'll explore how Transformer models tackle various tasks in natural language processing, speech, audio, and computer vision. We'll delve into the inner workings of these models and understand the general principles behind their task-solving capabilities.

---

# General Pattern of Tasks

- Input data processed through a model.
- Output interpreted for a specific task.
- Differences in data preparation, model architecture, and output processing.

???
Before diving into specific models, it's essential to understand the general pattern most tasks follow. Input data is fed into a model, and the output is interpreted based on the task requirements. The key differences lie in how the data is prepared, the choice of model architecture, and how the output is processed.

# Transformer Models for Language

- Language models understand and generate human language.
- Transformer architecture: encoder, decoder, or encoder-decoder.
- Tasks: text classification, token classification, question answering, text generation, summarization, translation.

???
Language models are at the core of modern NLP. They learn statistical patterns and relationships between words, enabling them to understand and generate human language. The Transformer architecture, with its encoder, decoder, or encoder-decoder variants, has become the default choice for solving various NLP tasks.

---

# How Language Models Work

- **Masked Language Modeling (MLM)**: Predicts masked tokens (BERT).
- **Causal Language Modeling (CLM)**: Predicts next token (GPT).

???
Language models are trained using two main approaches: Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Causal Language Modeling (CLM). MLM, used by encoder models like BERT, involves predicting randomly masked tokens based on surrounding context. CLM, used by decoder models like GPT, predicts the next token in a sequence based on previous tokens.

---

# Types of Language Models

1. **Encoder-only (BERT)**: Bidirectional context, tasks like classification.
2. **Decoder-only (GPT)**: Left-to-right processing, text generation.
3. **Encoder-decoder (BART)**: Sequence-to-sequence tasks like translation.

???
Language models can be categorized into three types based on their architecture: encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder. Encoder-only models like BERT use bidirectional context for tasks requiring deep text understanding. Decoder-only models like GPT process text from left to right, excelling at text generation. Encoder-decoder models like BART combine both approaches for sequence-to-sequence tasks.

---

# Text Classification

- Assigns predefined categories to text.
- **BERT**: Uses WordPiece tokenization, [CLS] token, and sequence classification head.

???
Text classification involves assigning labels to text documents. BERT, an encoder-only model, uses WordPiece tokenization to generate token embeddings. A special [CLS] token is added to represent the entire sequence, and a sequence classification head is used to predict the most likely label.

---

# Token Classification

- Assigns labels to each token.
- **BERT**: Adds token classification head for tasks like NER.

???
Token classification assigns labels to individual tokens in a sequence. BERT can be adapted for this task by adding a token classification head that predicts labels for each token based on the encoder's hidden states.

---

# Question Answering

- Finds answer in a given context.
- **BERT**: Uses span classification head to predict answer span.

???
Question answering involves finding answers within a given context. BERT can be used for this task by adding a span classification head that predicts the start and end positions of the answer span in the context.

---

# Text Generation

- Generates coherent text based on input.
- **GPT-2**: Uses causal language modeling, masked self-attention.

???
Text generation creates contextually relevant text based on a prompt. GPT-2, a decoder-only model, uses causal language modeling and masked self-attention to generate text. It predicts the next token based on previous tokens, ensuring coherent and contextually appropriate output.

---

# Summarization

- Condenses text while preserving key information.
- **BART**: Uses text infilling, encoder-decoder structure.

???
Summarization involves condensing longer text into a shorter version. BART, an encoder-decoder model, uses text infilling to corrupt the input and then reconstructs it. This approach teaches the model to predict the number of missing tokens, making it effective for summarization tasks.

---

# Translation

- Converts text from one language to another.
- **BART**: Adds separate encoder for source language.

???
Translation converts text from one language to another while preserving meaning. BART adapts to translation tasks by adding a separate encoder for the source language, which maps the source text to an input that can be decoded into the target language.

---

# Modalities Beyond Text

- Transformers applied to speech, audio, and images.
- **Wav2Vec2**: Audio classification, ASR.
- **ViT, ConvNeXT**: Image classification.

???
Transformers are not limited to text; they can also be applied to other modalities like speech, audio, and images. We'll briefly explore how models like Wav2Vec2 handle speech and audio data, and how ViT and ConvNeXT approach image classification tasks.

---

# Speech and Audio

- **Wav2Vec2**: Self-supervised model for audio tasks.
- Components: Feature encoder, quantization module, context network.

???
Wav2Vec2 is a self-supervised model pretrained on unlabeled speech data. It consists of a feature encoder that converts raw audio into feature vectors, a quantization module that learns discrete speech units, and a context network (Transformer encoder) that processes the quantized speech units.

---

# Audio Classification

- **Wav2Vec2**: Adds sequence classification head.
- Pools hidden states, transforms into logits over class labels.

???
For audio classification, Wav2Vec2 adds a sequence classification head that accepts the encoder's hidden states. These states are pooled and transformed into logits over the class labels, allowing the model to predict the most likely class for the input audio.

---

# Automatic Speech Recognition

- **Wav2Vec2**: Adds language modeling head for CTC.
- Transforms hidden states into logits, calculates CTC loss.

???
For automatic speech recognition, Wav2Vec2 adds a language modeling head that uses Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC). This head transforms the encoder's hidden states into logits, and the CTC loss is calculated to find the most likely sequence of tokens, which are then decoded into a transcription.

---

# Computer Vision

- Approaches: Patch-based Transformers, modern CNNs.
- **ViT**: Replaces convolutions with Transformer encoder.
- **ConvNeXT**: Uses convolutional layers with modern designs.

???
Computer vision tasks can be approached using patch-based Transformers or modern CNNs. ViT replaces convolutions entirely with a Transformer encoder, while ConvNeXT relies on convolutional layers but adopts modern network designs.

---

# Image Classification

- **ViT**: Splits image into patches, uses [CLS] token.
- **ConvNeXT**: Convolutional layers for feature extraction.

???
For image classification, ViT splits an image into patches, generates patch embeddings, and uses a [CLS] token to capture the overall image representation. ConvNeXT, on the other hand, uses convolutional layers to extract features from the image.

---

# Object Detection, Segmentation, Depth Estimation

- **DETR**: Object detection.
- **Mask2Former**: Image segmentation.
- **GLPN**: Depth estimation.

???
For other vision tasks like object detection, segmentation, and depth estimation, models like DETR, Mask2Former, and GLPN are better suited. These models are specifically designed to handle the complexities of these tasks.
